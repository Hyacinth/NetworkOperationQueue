Originally, the code was supposed to be run on Android and iOS in Cocos2D-x, but it is agnostic enough that it can be used on other platforms as well.

This implementation of the threaded network queue has a number of issues that one should pay attention to:

* in order to start/dequeue an operation you need to periodically call the update method on the NetworkOperationQueue
* threads are not reused, but each new operation starts its own thread (no worries, at a given time a max of 10 threads are allowed to be started)
* no support for HTTPS. The libcurl builds that I am using on Android and iPhone do not have OpenSSL support. If you intend to use this code with a SSL enabled CURL make sure you implement the locking functions needed for the SSL provider, otherwise the code will randomly crash on curl_easy_init. Resources:

Patches and feedback very much welcome.
